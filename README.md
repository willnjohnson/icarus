Icarus is an incremental upgrade survival platformer I created for COSC 452/552 for the Course Project Game Track at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. This is my first time getting used to Unity C# and really diving into object-oriented programming, so the scripts I've written are not perfect (and probably could be optimized or modularized more).  While I had intended to add more features like cache saving and time-based events, I've run out of time, but I'm happy with these final results.
